# BEM Methodology

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS, originally developed by Yandex. It is designed to create reusable, modular, and maintainable code.

BEM Structure BEM divides the user interface into independent blocks, which can be reused across different parts of the application. The naming convention follows a specific structure:

Block: block-name Element: block-name__element-name Modifier: block-name--modifier-name or block-name__element-name--modifier-name Example

example

In this example:

menu is the block. menu__list and menu__item are elements of the menu block. menu__item--active is a modifier that changes the appearance of the menu__item element. Benefits of BEM Clarity and Readability: BEM makes it clear what each class refers to by looking at its name. It is easy to identify whether a class represents a block, an element, or a modifier.

Modularity: BEM promotes the creation of independent components. Each block is standalone, making it easier to reuse and maintain.

Avoids Naming Conflicts: The structured naming convention helps avoid class name conflicts, which are common in larger projects with many contributors.

Improved Maintainability: With BEM, the CSS and HTML structure is more organized, making it easier to understand, debug, and modify the code.

Enhanced Scalability: BEM's approach is particularly useful for large projects as it provides a consistent methodology for naming and structuring classes.

Better Collaboration: The clarity and structure provided by BEM make it easier for multiple developers to work on the same project without confusion.

# known issues

With the booking system in the Bookings tab, the system is not fully developed/implemented yet but it is being worked on.
With each tab it will appear slightly off all it takes to make it look correct you just refresh the page with the reload button, ALT F5 or by clicking the same tab as you currently are on.

# Validators
There is a folder created for the validators for each page on the site plus the css
